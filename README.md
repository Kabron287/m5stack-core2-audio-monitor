# M5Stack Core 2 Audio

[![Demo Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CwIWpBqa-nM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwIWpBqa-nM)

This project is a nice little demo of audio on the M5Stack Core 2 with some simple visualisations.

You'll need to use PlatformIO to build the project.

To clone the repo use:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:atomic14/m5stack-core2-audio-monitor.git
```

This will make sure you get the M5Core2 library as well.
